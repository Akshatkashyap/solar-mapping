# Solar Mapping Platform - India

## Project Overview
A production-ready real-time solar mapping platform specifically designed for Indian terrain including cities and hills. This platform integrates weather data collection, solar irradiance analysis, and AI-powered energy predictions.

## Key Features
- Real-time weather data integration
- Solar irradiance analysis using ML models (Random Forest & LSTM)
- Interactive mapping for Indian cities and hilly regions
- Responsive dashboard for visualization
- Production-ready deployment configuration

## Technology Stack
- Frontend: React.js with TypeScript
- Backend: Node.js with Express
- Database: MongoDB for data storage
- ML Models: Python with scikit-learn and TensorFlow
- Maps: Custom map implementation with Leaflet.js
